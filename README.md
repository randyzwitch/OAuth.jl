My interpretation of the OAuth 1.0 protocol, based on my reading of [RFC5849](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849), the [liboauth](http://liboauth.sourceforge.net/) C library and factoring out the OAuth authentication code from [Twitter.jl](https://github.com/randyzwitch/Twitter.jl). At one point, this package relied on liboauth and was a wrapper of that library's functions built using [Clang.jl](https://github.com/ihnorton/Clang.jl); however, as I cleaned up the auto-generated functions from Clang, I decided that it would be easier and cleaner to re-write the library in Julia rather than require liboauth.

This is still a work-in-progress, but works as a replacement for the authentication in the Twitter.jl package, so it should be fairly complete in its implementation.
